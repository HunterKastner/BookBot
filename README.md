BookBot is my first backend project!
It takes any book, like Frankenstein for example, and returns a report
of the number of words and chars in the book.
This was made for a school project and as an entryway to learning python
and backend management!
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
